            <p>Sparse sensors responds to the availbilty of materal and resorces in making sensors with rubbish or scraps, or things on hand. The matter of sensors is entwined with how systems shape the way we see the world. Much of the data that these sensors prdoduce feeds into perceptions of the environmet - such as levels of particualte matter in the air, or water depth. The machines that produce these data are material instruments, collecting infomration in matterial ways.</p>
