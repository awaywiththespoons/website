            <p>Human Breadboards is an exploration into tangible interfaces for learning computing. As well as exploring methods for design learning, I made a series of interconnecting sensors and actuators that can be used for rapid prototyping interactive design ideas on the body.</p>

            <p>The project started through conversations between educators at the etextile summer camp 2015. I was particularly interested in (what I later learned was called) embodied learning, and through the project I started to think about embodied approaches to learning.</p>

            <p>The project started by exploring how young people could learn about computing through etextiles, and ended being part of a larger approach to learning about technology through sharing experiences (as wells as through sharing skills).
