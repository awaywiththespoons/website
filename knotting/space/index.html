<h2>Space for knots</h2>
<p>Knotting also led me to places I had not anticipated, such as baking a 'mug-cake' in a polythene bag! .</p>

<p>Baking a mug-cake in a bag refers to explorations in to the space that defines and controls knots. This is related to the<em> Environment</em> section. <em>Space</em> and <em>Environment</em> both explore the way that the local area to the knot has an impact in the way that it is formed. In Space however, I explore many more nuances of these 'local areas'.</p>
<p>Space started as a way to explore how knots are formed by other materials. I started this section through collaborating with molecular scientist Dave Glowacki. We got talking about knots and molecules, and from these conversations I learned that some theories suggest that DNA is coded through knots. Because there are few studies into knotting things so small, it is unclear how knotting on a molecular level happens, and we started to imagine how this would be possible. I made a series of knots in bags as a way to explore agency and knots. How do they form on their own? What are the conditions needed to form a knot?</p>

<p>Preparing to fill the bags</p>

<p>Bags full: I placed 23 pairs of strings in bags (the number is based on the number of human chromosones). Then filled the bags with: nothing (air), jelly, water, cake, resin, latex, angel delight, and seeds</p>

<p>I filmed the process of fill the bags (just for fun!)</p>

<p>To simulate movemnt, I made a 'bag' for the bags that could be worn around.</p>
