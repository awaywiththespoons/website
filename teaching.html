            <h3>2020 ~ Assosiate Lecturer on MA Design
                <br><em>Goldsmiths, University of London (UK)</em></h3>
            <p>I am currently a graduate-tutor at Goldsmiths. I teach on the "Transfocality" module, which is part of the MA Design degree that shifts the focus of design accross disciplines and contexts. I work with Jennifer Bain and Danialla Z on the trans-focal area of designing and learning, and worked with them to design the module "Narrow Corridors". Drawing from criical pedaggogies (hooks 1994, Freire 1970) students developed a radical response to an issue. Find out more.</p>
