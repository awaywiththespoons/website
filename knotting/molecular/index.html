<h2>Knotting Molecules</h2>
<p>Over the past few years, molecular scientist David Glowacki has been developing an interactive molecular simulation for his research. This is a virtual reality (VR) system that immerses you in a simulation of the nano-world, and in this world you are able to manipulate molecules. After our initial conversations, Dave added some features to the simulation to make long chains of molecules (polyethylene) with the view that we could explore the chains of molecules through knotting. As I have said, knotting is a dynamic process; it can also be an intuitive body movement. In this case, we used these intuitive knotting movements to view the molecules from the perspectives of our bodies. In her critique of the fixed and impartial position that science and technology has in our culture, Donna Haraway calls for a shift in how we view science:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I am arguing for a view from a body, always a complex, contradictory, structuring, and structuring body, versus from above, from nowhere, from simplicity&rdquo; (Haraway, 1989)</em></p>
<p>Through engaging with intuitive body movement of knot making we had a different perspective. And through our intuitive movements we were making steps towards creatively reimagining molecules.</p>
<p>Isabelle Stengers also argues for a change the way we approach science. She suggests that:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silencing the power of wonder is not to be identified with a scientific attitude. Rather, it designates science as it has been mobilised in defence of public order.&rdquo; (Stengers, 2010).</p>
<p>Stengers argues that taking the &ldquo;wonder&rdquo; out of science is contrary to a scientific attitude, and that this suppression is due to the use of science for public order. With this she is suggesting that instead of being a discipline of &ldquo;wonder&rdquo; a fixed and impartial notion of science is used as a system of control. As this biography demonstrates, knots are dynamic, process-driven objects that appear as magical in many cultural domains. To me, thinking about the magic of knotting with molecules is full of wonder.</p>

<p>X-ray crystallography was intially used to "see" molecular strucures through the diffraction of the waves. These images illustrate how this process is drawn out</p>

<p>Drawings from the diffracted waves were carefully mapped physically. John Kendrew was a pioneer of this technique, and won a nobel prize molecular modelling.</p>
