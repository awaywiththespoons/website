<h2>Overview</h2>
 <p><i>This is a biography of knots. It is a collection of social, cultural, material and scientific expressions of knotting, knots, knot-works, and knot-making.</i></p>

<p>In this project I conducted a number of small-scale experiments to explore material and cultural properties of knotting. Initially, I chose to explore knotting because I understood it as a metaphor for learning. I intended to carry out experiments that would bring the concepts I have been exploring in Design Education into a material realm through knots. I chose knots because I am interested the tension between their material qualities and their dynamic properties. Knots are a <i>material</i> thing, but they are also a dynamic <i>process</i>. The dialogue between material and process intrigues me, and it resonated with some of the research into <i>situated learning</i> that I have been carrying out. </p>

<p>The process of making this biography was not <i>teleological</i>. I have tried to move between characteristics and definitions of knotting without a clear end point in sight. This is reflected in the diverse collection of knotting contexts, objects, and processes in this site. And because there was not a pre-defined 'goal' it been such a joy to work on this biography. I hope to continue to work in this way in my beyond the MA, in my teaching and practice. </p>
