            <h4>Game design studio at NuVu, Glasgow</h4>
            <p>This two week game design studio was a creative and technical exploration into AR games. It was designed for young people (aged 12-16), and students learned how to used Unity3D to make table-top AR games. There was a lot of creative development, such as discussion around what makes a game (and what makes a game fun). Students also learned by playing games (lots of them &#8211; theatre games, traditional games, bonkers games, games from the crowd, board games), and they used collage, drawing, and writing techniques to support visual ideas and develop and stories. By the end of the two weeks students had learned how to work between Photoshop and Unity3D to create sprites and basic character animation. They also build games to iOS with Vuforia to add the AR interaction.</p>
