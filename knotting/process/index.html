<h2>Knotting Processes</h2>
<p>Knots resonated with some of the concepts of learning we have been exploring in Design Education. Initially, I was drawn to knots through Engestr&ouml;m&rsquo;s theory of learning, in which he likens the learning process to knot-making. Juliet Sprake describes it here:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Learning is exploratory movement in space and the meaningful encounters that occur between &lsquo;heterogeneous actors and their lives of movement&rsquo; that Engestr&ouml;m likens to knot forming. These collaborative &lsquo;knots&rsquo; are particularly critical between nonlinear wayfaring trails and predominantly straightforward lines of transport&rdquo; (Sprake, 2012)</em></p>
<p>Knots remind me of <em>embodied </em>and <em>dynamic</em> learning &ndash;both are ways of being &ldquo;situated&rdquo; in learning. Being situated in learning is to learn through multiple sensory experiences, <em>and </em>learn through interconnecting perspectives. Knots are a metaphor for this, because of their affordance to make connections through their material properties.</p>
