<h2>Magic Knots</h2>

 <p>For this section I wanted to investigate how knots were imagined from a social or cultural perspective. I was interested in the characteristic they are imbued with by people, and I reviewed related literature in folktales, myths, and stories. What emerged from the literature was that knots have a diverse symbolic history. Knots have been imagined to have various characteristics that are beyond their material quality by many cultures over time, and they have distinct meanings in different cultures. </p>

<p>For example, Ingold suggests that some decorative knots have a magical quality. These kinds of knots use their interweaving paths like a labyrinth to disorientate and trap unwanted spirits. Notions of evil get lost in the loops, and the knots are used for protection. </p>

<p>Judith Scott knotted things. Knots were one of the few conversations she had with the world. She was an artist from the Oakland based Creative Growth Studio, but she also spent a lot of her life institutionalised. She had Down’s Syndrome, and was deaf and mute and spent the start of her life in hospitals. She didn’t start making work until joining the studio. </p>

<p>One of my understandings of her work is that Scott's knots mummify things to elevate them. Inside the art works are everyday objects, tied-up in sacred bundles, hidden, and made mysterious. But all the same, these Egyptian-like monuments to things are poised, perched, in some kind of still motion that is given by the potential movement embedded in the knot. As well as the elevated status, they have the constant possibility of being undone. It is so sacred, but at the same time so close to being nothing.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;this cosmology rested upon a belief in the inherent superiority of the immaterial world. But it was the ancient Egyptians' faith in the potential of monumentality to express immateriality that has created their legacy as a material presence in our own world. We continue to be enthralled by statues, mummies, and pyramids because of the very exuberant faith that the Egyptians put into the orifices of materialization as a means for securing their own immortal transubstantiation. They thereby created among the first monuments to humanities’ search for a means to transcend our own materiality.&rdquo; (Miller, 2005)</em></p>

<p>I also got a book out of the library called &ldquo;The Art of Knotting and Splicing&rdquo; by Cyrus Lawrence Day. It was originally published in 1947 as a follow up to his 1935 book &ldquo;Sailors&rsquo; Knots&rdquo;. The book is a treasure trove of knots and has the most wonderful illustrations, including arrows to indicate direction and flow of the rope.</p>
<p>In the intro to the book Day emphasized the on-going association with knots and magic, mysticism, and folklore. According to Day there is evidence that knots are understood by many cultures as having magical properties:</p>

<p>1. the Latin <i>religio</i> (religion) and <i>religare</i> (to tie or bind).<br />
2. &ldquo;wizards and witches (or people regarded as such) used to claim the power of tying up the wind with charmed knots&rdquo;<br />
3. in Homer&rsquo;s  epic: Aeolus (the king of winds) ties up the winds in knots and places them in a leather bag to give to Ulysses<br />
4. knots were considered a superstitious birth control -when two Scandinavian parents wanted to stop having more kids, they would call their last offspring Knut (meaning knot) hoping to prevent conception of another child<br />
5. Knots were believed to be able to cast spells for &ldquo;marring wedded happiness&rdquo;, inflicting diseases and breaking bones.<br />
6. But they were also used to cure: &ldquo;diseases of the groin can be cured by tying 7 or 9 knots in a thread, naming a widow as each knot is tied, and tying the knots to the patients' groin&rdquo;.<br />
7. &ldquo;the love-knot is probably the most familiar magic knot&rdquo;, and Day quotes passages referencing &ldquo;love-knots&rdquo; in literature over the past 500 years</p>
