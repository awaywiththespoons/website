<h2>Tensions between knots</h2>
<p>Ingold also has a metaphorical perspective on knotting. He suggests that knots are a metaphor for <em>attachments</em> at the nodes of networks. By doing so, he adds a dimension to various network theories such as <em>Assemblage,</em> and <em>Actor Network Theory (ANT)</em>. The knots in lines cause him to question how networks are joined, and what kind of tensions holds them together, and I explored tension through the material of the line making the knot. A slippery noodle has less tension than woolly yarn.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Whether the parts add up to a whole or not, what is missing from the additive logic is the tension and friction that make it possible for persons and things to cling. There is no movement. In the assemblage, it is as though the dancers had turned to stone.</em></p>
<p><em>The theory of assemblage, then, will not help us. It is too static, and it fails to answer the </em><em>question of how entities of which it is composed actually fasten to each other. The principle of the line, by contrast, allows us to bring the social back to life. In the life of lines, parts are not components; they are movements&rdquo;</em><em> <em>(Ingold, 2015)</em></em></p>
