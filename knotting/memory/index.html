<h2>Knotting Memories</h2>

<p>I was curious about the connection between knots and memory. Knots are used as mnemonic devices in Incan culture. They used a knotting system called &ldquo;Quipu&ldquo;. Knots are also used to hold memories together in Coptic bookbinding. Knots are both a memory (they are mnemonic devices), and a framework of memory (they provide structure for pages). </p>

<p>In this section I explored a knot as a holder of memories through binding books with knots. I made the books from empty pages (post-it notes and zip-lock bags), as a way to explore the knot’s function in the book, highlighting its role as a binder, and a connector.</p>

 <p>Quipu is a process of mnemonic knot making made by Inca cultures. Inca cultures had no written text or money, and through the process of knot-making they recorded things such as transfer of property, or powers. Strings are tied in certain ways using colour, distance, direction, and knot formation as signifiers. The coded system of knots are still a bit of a mystery and we still only know what about two thirds mean.</p>

<p>There are many things that I find fascinating about this process of remembering. One is that the way of remembering reflects the materiel abundant in the culture (Inca’s we masters of the art of weaving and knotting. Their technical understanding was so advance that they made suspension bridges out of just knotted ropes -knotted architectures!)</p>

<p>I find that the Quipu process of recording resonates with other impressions of knotting that I have. Recording in this instance has a temporal and spatial relationship with the body. They are thought in motion. The act of knotting is a movement on multiple dimensions. In the case of the Quipu the hands of the maker are moving on multiple planes, and the knotted-record protrudes. It is the object of a memory that can be recollected through both on sight and touch.</p>

<p>I also reviewed some literature relating to Quipu. From this, it emerged that (similar to Engestrom<i>'s </i>concept of 'horizontal or sideways learning') Quipu knots have the potential to provide a non-directional framework for recording memories:</p>

<p><i> 'The quipumakers connected strings to each other, space became defined by the points where the strings were attached. The establishment of these points did not have to follow any set left to right or right to left sequence. The relative positions of the strings are set by their points of attachment, and it is there relative position that renders them meaningful' (Ascher, 1997)</i></p>

<p>Knots also have a memory in themselves. Tim Ingold describes this:</p>

<p><i>'The knot remembers everything, and has everything to forget. Untying the knot, there is not a disarticulation. It does not break things into pieces. It is rather a casting off. Whence lines that once were bound together go their different ways.' (Ingold, 2015)</i></p>
