 <h2>Environment</h2>

<p>The knot experiments I made in the Environment section were used as a metaphor for situated learning. I was interested in situated knotting. How is knotting situated? How does the situation impact the knotwork? I made a series of experiments where I left strings to knot over a time period in different contexts. The knot strands (above) were left in different environments for 5 days.</p>
<p>The result was a series of beautifully interconnected knotworks. The lines of strings that formed the knots moved about the environment without any regard for directionality. This resonates with how Engestr&ouml;m views learning:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We habitually tend to depict learning and development as vertical processes, aimed at elevating humans upward, to higher levels of competence...I suggest that we construct a complementary perspective, namely that of horizontal or sideways learning and development.&rdquo; (</em><em>Engestr&ouml;m, 2004)</em> </p>
<p>Engestr&ouml;m reflects on the negative associations with upwardly linier metaphors for learning. The metaphor he prefers to use for learning is multi-directional, like the lines of strings when they form a knot in the hangings.</p>

<p>The knot-works assembled: no-knots, my-knots, bag-knots, studio-knots, wind-knots</p>
<h2>Studio-knots</h2>
<p>These knot were made by me in the studio.</p>

<h2>Bag-knots</h2>
<p>These knot were made in my bag.</p>

<h2>Collective-knots</h2>
<p>These knot were made collectively by students at Goldsmiths.</p>

<h2>Wind-knots</h2>
<p>These knot were made in my garden, by leaving them to the elements.</p>
