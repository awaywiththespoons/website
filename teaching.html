            Undergraduate module on BA Creative Media Design, University of the West of England
            <p>In this module students designed mobile media that connects people and place. They developed ideas through situated or responsive activities: open-ended methods to engage hands-on and in-situ with some of the underlying ideas in the module. And designed mobile apps that encouraged participants to re-view, re-imagine, or re-think their surroundings. </p>
