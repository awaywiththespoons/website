            <p>The work asks questions about what information can and should be collected, and if this data being used for the common good or corporate gain. We invited people to explore these questions through a range of interactive exhibits, artworks, and activities. People were invited take part through role-play: They found out, visualised, and collected data based on a randomly assigned roles – giving them the opportunity to explore different perspectives. We also added multiple-modes of interaction, making the data feel tangible. The exhibition opened in May 2018 and ran until November 2018.</p>
