            <p>Commons Sense was a citizen sensing exhibition at Knowle West Media Centre, which explored the contexts and tools for citizen led sensing. I worked in collaboration with Pete Bennett and KWMC to design the interactive space, and the exhibition ran from May until November 2018.</p>

            <p>We invited people to explore ideas of data commons through a range of interactive exhibits, artworks, and activities. People were invited take part through role-play. They found out, visualised, and collected data based on a randomly assigned roles â€“ giving them the opportunity to explore different perspectives. We also added multiple-modes of interaction, making the data feel tangible.</p>
