            <p>Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm a maker, and I'm one of those people that does loads of things (delete as approprite: designer /researcher /producer /curater /educator /artist /coder /drawer /sewer /knitter).</p>

            <p>There are two main ðŸ§µthreadsðŸ§µ that run through my practice: </p>
            <p>ðŸ§µ One is that I explore how computers see us and we see them. This means that most of my work revolves around sensing and sensors <em>(related story - my pa makes photo-sensors for a living and I grew up with them in bits and pieces EVERYWHERE in the house).</em></p>
            <p>ðŸ§µ The other thread is that my work has an embdeded pedgagogy or community practice, and most work I do invovles making with others (MWO).</p>

            <p>I've worked with some brilliant orgnaisaitons over the years, and been resident in a number of schools, museums, and arts spaces. I have also spent a number of years teaching as a lecturer and high school teacher. For more info you can  <a href="/cv.html">view my CV</a>.</p>

            <p>Currently, I am carrying out an <a href="https://www.designstar.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AHRC</a> funded PhD at <a href="https://www.gold.ac.uk/design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goldsmiths</a>, where I am exploring learning and technology. I am a resident artist at the <a href="http://www.watershed.co.uk/studio/residents/becca-rose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pervasive Media Studio</a> and I am co-curating art and technology programme <a href="https://www.control-shift.network/" target="_blank">Control Shift</a>.</p>

            <p>Send me a <a href="mailto:hello@beccarose.co.uk">message</a> if you have any Qs.</p>
